When applying for jobs,
I usually imagine how would it be working for that company,
and I keep a few questions in mind.

---

One of them is:
How's the routine working for the company?

I try to imagine how would a day or a week be like as an employee.
What is the size of my team,
and from whom do I get the requirements for the task.

---

Another question to understand the position better is,
from your perspective, what are the biggest challenges I'd face in the role?

---

Last, but definitely no least, is whether there's a career plan or a growth opportunity,
and what is the criteria for growing inside the company.
