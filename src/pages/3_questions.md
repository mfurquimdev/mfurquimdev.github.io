For this video,
I'll tell you about a few questions I usually keep in mind when Iâ€™m applying for jobs.

---

One of them is about the routine working for the company.
What is the size of my team
and from whom do I get the requirements for the tasks?

---

The second question to understand the position even better is,
from your perspective, what are the biggest challenges I'd face in the role?

---

Last, but definitely not least,
is whether there's a career plan or a growth opportunity,
and what are the criteria for growing inside the company.
