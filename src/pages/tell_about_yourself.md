Hi, my name is Mateus Furquim and I'm 30 years old.


I was born and raised in Brasília,
the capital of Brazil,
where I currently live with my wife.

---

I graduated in Software Engineering from Universidade de Brasília in 2017,
And, ever since my first class on programming,
I was in love with solving problems
leveraging the power of the computer.


My most recent specialization in Machine Learning DevOps engineering
is just a natural progression of this passion,
and a great opportunity to improve my client's workflow and tool stack.

---

I've already been to Canada twice.
Once during my high school to study English in Vancouver.
And the second time I spent 16 months doing part of my graduation at the University of Victoria.


By the end of this exchange program,
I was divided between staying in that wonderful country
or coming back to my family that I missed so much.


Now that I've reached a point that I want to start my own family,
I want to live in a country with better perspectives and security.


I hope this year my dream starts taking shape by moving back to Canada with my beloved one.
