Hi, my name is Mateus Furquim and I'm 30 years old.

---

I was born and raised in the Brazilian capital,
and I currently live with my fiancé.
I graduated from Universidade de Brasília in 2017.

---

Ever since my first class on programming,
I was in love with solving problems
leveraging the power of the computer.

---

My most recent specialization in Machine Learning DevOps engineer
is just a natural progress of this passion,
and a great opportunity to improve my client's workflow and tool stack.

---

In my high school I went to study English in Vancouver
and during my graduation I spent 16 months studying Software Engineer at the University of Victoria in Canada.

---

By the end of this exchange program,
I was divided between staying in that wonderful country
and coming back to my family that I missed so much.

---

Now that I've reached a point that I want to start my own family,
I want to live in a country with better perspectives and security.

---

I hope this year my dream start taking shape by moving back to Canada with my beloved one.
