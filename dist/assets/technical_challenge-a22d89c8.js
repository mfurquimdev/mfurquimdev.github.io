They use artificial intelligence to identify each appliance’s consumption. Simply put, every house appliance has its own fingerprint, So they know if that amount of energy is coming from a dishwasher or an electric shower.</p><hr><p>Having this context in mind, I’m going to briefly describe the problem.</p><p>The service runs every thirty minutes, expecting the data to be present for the disaggregation</p><p>So, every thirty minutes the service expects the data to be present and run the disaggregation. In the case there’s no data, we had to implement a special logic.</p><hr><p>From early 2022 up to mid October, we have found four different scenarios that we weren’t covering. So we spent a few weeks each time to fix it and validate the solution.</p><hr><p>On January of 2023, we found yet another exception. But instead of adding a fifth rule in the code, I stepped back to look at the problem as a whole.</p><hr><p>The issue was our presupposition. We expected to have data every thirty minutes.</p><p>But, as we’ve seen in the last year, this might not always be the case.</p><p>I called a meeting with my colleagues and proposed the idea of implementing an event based architecture. Instead of expecting the data to be there at regular intervals, the service will be notified <em>when</em> the data arrives. This will ensure the data is always present for the disaggregation.</p><p>The takeaway is: “if something is giving a lot of trouble, there might be a better approach”</p><hr><hr><hr><hr><hr><hr><hr><hr><hr><hr><hr><hr><hr><hr><hr></div>',2),p="Discuss a Technical Challenge You Have Faced",w=[{property:"og:title",content:"Discuss a Technical Challenge You Have Faced"}],d={__name:"technical_challenge",setup(g,{expose:t}){return t({frontmatter:{title:"Discuss a Technical Challenge You Have Faced",meta:[{property:"og:title",content:"Discuss a Technical Challenge You Have Faced"}]}}),h({title:"Discuss a Technical Challenge You Have Faced",meta:[{property:"og:title",content:"Discuss a Technical Challenge You Have Faced"}]}),(f,v)=>(i(),n("div",c,[e("div",{class:"text-center"},[o(" You can use Vue components inside markdown "),e("h1",null,s(p))]),l]))}},b=a(d,[["__file","/home/mfkn/projects/mfurquim/mfurquimdev.github.io/src/pages/technical_challenge.md"]]);export{b as default,w as meta,p as title};
