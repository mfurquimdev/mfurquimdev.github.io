Back-end instrumentation for throughput, latency and error rate.
Automation of service discovery for a federation of Prometheus.


Increased observability in the back-end services by instrumenting with Prometheus metrics and visualizing with Grafana dashboards.

Created alerts using PromQL for high throughput, latency and error rate for detecting possible DDoS attacks and low performance of new deployments
Utilized PromQL and Prometheus to create alerts for detecting high throughput, latency, error rate, and potential DDoS attacks, as well as low performance of new deployments.

Assisted on the creation of a self-detected services using etcd and a federation of Prometheus
Assisted in developing self-discovering services by utilizing etcd, consistent hashing and a federation of Prometheus.
