At CanAssist, I was hired in January for Co-op program with UVic.
I worked until April and did a couple more days on weekend for an exposition of the projects we developed inside.
I worked in a couple different projects.

The first one was an embedded system capable of identifying different events through security devices which emitted Z Waves.
The event would reach the BeagleBone Black or Raspberry Pi via a Z Wave receptor.
The device was capable of making a call to a registered number.
When the person accepted the call, a menu written in Asterisk would be played.

The device was also capable to convert Text to Speech. This way, we could generate dynamically the name of the person.

The elderly care system notifies a relative.

Improve the quality of life for elderly people and people with physical or mental disabilities.


Many elderly people reach a point when a few tasks become gradually difficult, until it no longer makes sense to...

Some elderly people have difficulty distinguishing day and night.
At times, they leave their houses at 2 am expecting to have an open coffee shop as if it were day time.

Relieve the worry of the elderly relatives by letting them know if the door has been open in between night hours.
